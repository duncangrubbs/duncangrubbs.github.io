While both writer and reader-based prose have their purposes, there are also large differences between the two. These differences can mainly be seen in the way the writer organizes concepts and conclusions. While writer-based prose often comes more naturally to people, reader-based prose is more difficult for most, and is usually seen in revisions. This is because writer-based prose can be used as a step in processing information. Using methods such as listing facts or narrative writing helps the writer understand the information and conceptualize it. When using reader-based prose, the writer has to see their writing from the reader’s perspective, and in turn, cater to that perspective. Reader-based prose is often seen in later drafts, and is marked by well organized facts, concepts, and conclusions. The writer must make an attempt to directly communicate a concept with clear, logical writing that follows a more conversational pattern.
	In her piece “Writer-Based Prose: A Cognitive Basis for Problems in Writing”, the author, Linda Flower, often uses reader-based prose through section introductions such as: “In the remainder of this paper I will look at the features of Writer-Based prose and the ways it functions for the writer” (Flower 26). By saying this, Flower gives the reader a look at the broader structure of the piece, allowing for deeper understanding. In contrast, Flower also gives examples of writer-based prose saying: “Our first meeting, held February 17th, was with the head of the sales department, Jim Tucker” (Flower 23). While the style of prose is deliberate, I think this sentence best highlights the use of simple, narrative style writing that forms with the writer's initial thoughts.
